## Inspiration
Me and my teammate, have a few hobbies and this was a great opportunity for us to channelize our imaginations to run wild and showcase our hobbies in the most creative way.

## What it does
The project displays our hobbies. We currently have 2 hobbies. Football from sports and Playing the piano from the music world.

## How we built it
For the techstack, we choose reactjs, nodejs, expressjs along with a few frontend CSS libraries like tailwindCSS, Bootstrap. We have coordinated our work using Git and Github. For deployment of the app, we have preferred Heroku.

## Challenges we ran into
We have never designed and written code for complex CSS animations. For this 1.5 days of hackathon, we had prepared ourselves by learning complex animations and styling.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully finished our project which went along as planned.

## What we learned
Collaboration. Designing and coding complex animations.

## What's next for Hackbytes-2022
We are planning to learn more of complex CSS animations and will use them to bring our creative and imaginative ideas on the canvas. Our focus will be on making the website look more creative and fun to interact with.
